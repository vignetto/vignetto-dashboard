      %h2.title PACKAGES
      Packages differ from Events because they combine multiple itinerary items that could include transportation, multiple private tastings, and lunch. A couple can book themselves two seats on a limo bus with three private pinot tastings and lunch, or you sign up for helicopter tours and lunch in a vineyard for four people. Either way, we have unique option for your group of 2 â€“ 10 people can enjoy.
